What is the single most important design principle for designing functions?

# Answer 2.
One of the single most important design principles for designing functions is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
 This principle introduced by Robert C. Martin, states that a function (or a method)
 should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or do one thing.

When a function adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle it becomes more modular maintainable and easier to
understand. It simplifies the code reduces the chances of introducing bugs when modifications are made and enhances code
readability. Following SRP helps create a more flexible and scalable codebase by ensuring that each function is focused
on a specific task or responsibility.

What is the Python keyword for returning a value from a function?

# Answer 3.

In Python the keyword used to return a value from a function is return. When a return statement is executed in a
function it immediately exits the function and passes the specified value back to the caller

# 4.
What are arguments and parameters? What is the difference between them?

# Answer 4.
Parameters:
Parameters are the variables listed in the function or method signature.

They act as placeholders for the actual values (arguments) that will be passed to the function when it is called.

Parameters are part of the function definition and are used to specify the input requirements of the function.

Arguments:

Arguments are the actual values that are passed to a function when it is called.

They correspond to the parameters of the function and provide the actual data that the function will operate on.

The number and order of arguments must match the parameters defined in the function.

What is the Python function call for generating a random number between 1 and 100?

# Answer 5.

In Python, you can use the random module to generate a random number.
Specifically, the randint() function from the random module can be used to generate a random integer within a
specified range.
eg:
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(random_number)

# Answer 6.
a. print(): Used to print output to the console.
b. len(): Used to get the length (number of items) of an object, such as a string, list, or tuple.
c. input(): Used to take user input from the console.
d. random.randint(): Used to generate a random integer within a specified range.
